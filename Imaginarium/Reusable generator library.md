Reusable generator library
===================
This project is to build a set of game-neutral generators inside *Imaginarium* for things that commonly appear in tabletop role-playing games.

What's the project?
----------
The idea here is to build a library of generators for characters and other things that routinely appear in a wide range of TTRPGs, so that a single generator can be used for multiple games.  Examples would be:

- Character appearance
   - General appearance (e.g. "short, world-weary blond")
   - Specific facial appearance 
   - Clothing style (this one is harder, since it would have to be broken up by decade/century or subculture)
- Character personality (e.g "friendly but high-strung")
- Businesses
   - For malls or airport terminals (fast food, jewelry, etc.)
   - For office buildings (lawyer, dentist, CPA, etc.)
- Whatever else you can think of


What is the primary kind of work you'll be doing?
----------
Using Imaginarium

What knowledge do you need to be able to do it?
-------------
- Ideally CS 396 AI and Experimental Narrative 

What kind of person will find it interesting?
-----------
Someone who's interested in knowledge representation

What will you learn from it?
------------
Constraint-based knowledge representation

Can I publish this in a conference or journal?
-------
Maybe an EXAG paper. But mostly this would be something that would hopefully be used by players and if nothing else used in 396.
