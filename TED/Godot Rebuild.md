Translate Voix de la Ville to Godot
===================
This project would be to create a translation of our prototype research game - Voix de la Ville - to the Godot Engine. 

What is the primary kind of work you'll be doing?
----------
C# programming within Godot

What knowledge do you need to be able to do it?
-------------
- C# and UI programming
- CS 376 or equivalent

What kind of person will find it interesting?
-----------
UI Hackers - people that love front end work and aspiring Game Developers (Indie in particular)

What will you learn from it?
------------
Experience with a medium sized code base for a game (not a large comercial game, but much larger than any 376 assignments). Potentially, experience with novel Game AI techniques (depends on how much of the core game needs changing). Also, the Godot Engine/Framework.

Can I publish this in a conference or journal?
-------
This is more infrastructure for research than research itself. You could likely get a demo or possibly software-track publication at the AIIDE conference, but this isn't research in the sense of inventing new algorithms.

What's the project?
----------
The core game logic is writen in C# and won't need to be edited much to switch out the UI, while the UI code is about as isolated as we could manage. We have a very basic Godot project setup that already has a major portion of the code base working - albeit with no UI. The project would involve making UI elements such as a table display, graph visualizer, and tilemap style graphics in Godot and hooking them up to the interfaces present in Voix de la Ville.
