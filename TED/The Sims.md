Use TED and Socialog to make The Sims
===================
This project would be to create a prototype version of The Sims based on the framework established in Voix de la Ville. 

What is the primary kind of work you'll be doing?
----------
C# programming within Unity

What knowledge do you need to be able to do it?
-------------
- C# and UI programming
- CS 376 or equivalent
- CS 348 might be helpful

What kind of person will find it interesting?
-----------
Somebody who likes game programming, C# programming, etc.

What will you learn from it?
------------
Experience with a medium sized code base for a game (not a large comercial game, but much larger than any 376 assignments). Also, experience with novel Game AI techniques.

Can I publish this in a conference or journal?
-------
This is more infrastructure for research than research itself. You could likely get a demo or possibly software-track publication at the AIIDE conference, but this isn't research in the sense of inventing new algorithms.

What's the project?
----------
Voix de la Ville (our prototype research game) would be used as a base for the development of this prototype version of The Sims.
